I've created a complete HTML mockup for your grocery store inventory management system that addresses all three primary tasks you requested. Here's what the system includes:

1. Inventory Management
Complete product listing with search functionality
Stock level indicators (low, medium, good) with visual cues
Quick actions for editing products and reordering
Product categorization and organization


2. Real-Time Billing System
Product search/barcode scanning interface
Shopping cart with quantity adjustment
Automatic calculation of subtotal, tax, and final amount
Payment method selection
When a sale is completed, inventory would update automatically


3. Low Stock Alerts
Visual notifications for low and out-of-stock items
Configurable alert thresholds and notification methods
Comprehensive alert management system
Quick reordering options from the alerts panel


The dashboard provides at-a-glance metrics about your inventory and sales, with special emphasis on low stock items that need attention. The system is designed with a clean, modern interface that's easy to navigate.

The system is fully responsive and would work on both desktop and mobile devices, making it convenient to manage your grocery store from anywhere.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the system in more detail, or would you like to make any adjustments to the design?
